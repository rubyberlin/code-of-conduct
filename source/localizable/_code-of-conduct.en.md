Purpose
-------

A primary goal of all the conferences and user groups that follow this Code of Conduct is to create an inclusive community that welcomes and supports as many people with various backgrounds and identities as possible. As such, we are committed to build a friendly and safer environment for all. These various backgrounds and identities include (but are not limited to) gender identity and expression, sex, sexual orientation, educational level, mental and physical ability, immigration status, race, ethnicity, national origin, social and economic status, age, size and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our events to help us create safer and positive experiences for everyone.


Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
--------------------------------------

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and understand how our actions effect our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist. Positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone making an extra effort to ensure a welcoming, friendly, and encouraging community, we are happy to hear about it.


Expected Behavior
-----------------

*	Participate in a reliable and sharing way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
*	Exercise thoughtfulness and respect in your speech and actions.
*	Attempt collaboration before conflict.
*	Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
*	Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem minor or trivial.


Unacceptable Behavior
---------------------

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions - be it online, at all related events, during presentations and in one-on-one communications in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all people present at these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to all previously mentioned backgrounds and identities; inappropriate use of nudity, violent and/or sexual imagery; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.


Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
-------------------------------------

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).


If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior
------------------------------------------------------

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior,
or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as
possible. You can find a list of organizers to contact for each of the
supporters of this code of conduct at the bottom of this page. Additionally,
community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. If a person experiencing distress needs an accompanying person during in-person events, organizers will do their best to provide them.


Addressing Grievances
---------------------

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the event organizers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.


Scope
-----

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
